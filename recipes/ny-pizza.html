    <h3>Description</h3>
        Don’t confuse this pizza with sfincione, which is a traditional pizza from Sicily <br> 
        that contains breadcrumbs, anchovy, and caciocavallo cheese. The pizza I’m referring <br>
        to is the pizza you’d get if you walked into a New York area pizzeria and ordered a <br>
        “slice of Sicilian”. 
        <br><br>
        Pictured right below, this popular type of pizza is the thickest of the 3 most common <br>
        pizza styles found in New York. It has a thick airy texture with a crisp bottom and <br>
        is made in a rectangular pan using block mozzarella cheese, lots of sauce, oregano, <br>
        and Pecorino Romano cheese.
