    <h3>Description</h3>
        Don’t confuse this pizza with sfincione, which is a traditional pizza from Sicily <br> 
        that contains breadcrumbs, anchovy, and caciocavallo cheese. The pizza I’m referring <br>
        to is the pizza you’d get if you walked into a New York area pizzeria and ordered a <br>
        “slice of Sicilian”. 
        <br><br>
        Pictured right below, this popular type of pizza is the thickest of the 3 most common <br>
        pizza styles found in New York. It has a thick airy texture with a crisp bottom and <br>
        is made in a rectangular pan using block mozzarella cheese, lots of sauce, oregano, <br>
        and Pecorino Romano cheese.
        <br><br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>813 grams bread flour or roughly 6 1/2 cups</li>
        <li>521 grams cold tap water or 2 1/4 cups</li>
        <li>3 grams instant yeast or 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>16 grams fine sea salt or 2 3/4 teaspoons</li>
        <li>9.5 grams sugar or 2 1/4 teaspoons</li>
        <li>27 grams olive oil or 2 tablespoons</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by filling a large bowl (large enough to comfortably accommodate the dry <br>
            ingredients and the water with a lot of space leftover) with the water.  In <br>
            another bowl (the one pictured in step 1),  add all the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients with a wooden or rubber spoon.</li>   
        <li>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the water and begin mixing as best you can. <br>
            Add the olive oil to the rough dough.  I like to drizzle some of it around <br>
            the sides of the bowl to more easily pick up all the flour remnants.  Mix <br>
            again as best you can to form a rough shaggy dough ball.</li>
    </ol>
